This folder contains all the static content which is being displayed on the website.
Static folder is accessible from your browser by adding /static/content in your url link.
for ex. http://127.0.0.1:5000/static/readme.txt this url can open this file in the browser.
Note that we can't open just the static folder in our browser since it will then expose all the content of the static folder to the client 
i.e. http://127.0.0.1:5000/static if we try to open this link then it will give error but we can open any specific content inside the static folder
